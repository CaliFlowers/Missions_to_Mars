## Web Scraping
   The Internet is full of data; but it is unfortunate that most of this data does not come in readily useable forms such as .csv files. To get around this, data analysts have developed several tools like APIs to obtain information online. However, many sites do not have these convenient API services. For such purposes, Python developers have developed libraries like Beautiful Soup to facilitate "scraping" information directly off webpages. Web scraping is done by reducing a webpage to its HTML components; then iextracting the information of interest through the targeteting of HTML tags. This can be relatively simple as most content is conveniently marked by specific tags. 
   However, as the use of Javascript and non-HTML languages has risen in contemporary web development, scraping has become complicated by a multiplicity of tags burying desired information. Much of the data on the Internet has been placed outside the reach of inexperienced scrapersrelying on simple scraping methods.
