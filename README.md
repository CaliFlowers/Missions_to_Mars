## Web Scraping
   The Internet is full of data; but it is unfortunate that most of this data does not come in readily useable forms such as .csv files. To get around this, data analysts have developed several tools like APIs to obtain information online. However, many sites do not have these convenient API services. For such purposes, Python developers have developed libraries like Beautiful Soupto "scrap" information off webpages.
